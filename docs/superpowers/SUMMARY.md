# ProofLens Analytics v4 — Delivery Summary

Branch: `frontend/analytics-v4` (off Phase A `frontend/analytics-redesign`). Every change is
**additive** — scoring / engine / webhook / golden set are byte-for-byte unchanged. Full spec
saved at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-analytics-v4-consolidated-spec.md`.

Governing authorities: `docs/BRAND.md` + `docs/VERDICT_COPY.md`. Non-negotiables held throughout:
honest states (no fake AI, no fabricated data), small-sample guards, verbatim verdict sentences on
verdict surfaces (short labels only in aggregates), the drill-down contract, and zero scoring change.

## The page's four questions → what serves each (decision audit)

Every component maps to one of the four questions the page must answer, in order:

| Question | Components that answer it |
|---|---|
| **1 · Is capture risk rising?** | Suspect-rate KPI (+delta) · Capture-risk trend (vs previous-period avg) · "What changed" rail (suspect/avg-score/duplicate shifts) |
| **2 · What is driving flags?** | Top flag reasons (bar list) · Band mix per period · "dominant reason" insight |
| **3 · Where — which teams?** | "Where to look" team-hotspot bar list (branch/city/SM/RSM/SRSM/zone) |
| **4 · What should I do?** | "Review flagged captures" CTA · Flag-precision (are the flags trustworthy?) · drill-down from reasons/insights → /history |
| *(cross-cutting)* | System-health line (Pain 9), export (CSV/PDF), insights-rail freshness stamp — keep the four answers honest and actionable |

No component fails to serve one of the four. Removals are logged below.

## Root causes (Pains 1–2)

- **Pain 1 (overflow):** the reasons card locked to a 280px `ChartCard` while the row-count control
  sat *inside the body* and each reason rendered as two lines (label line + a separate bar). At
  Top 10 the ten two-line rows + the header + the in-body selector exceeded 280px, and the
  non-scrolling branch had no overflow containment → the card spilled. (The card-grid "overflow"
  the earlier report flagged was a *false positive* — CSS `scrollWidth` on a `.truncate` element.)
  Fix: rebuilt as a single-line bar list; selector moved to the card header; list always scrolls
  inside the card.
- **Pain 2 (rough tooltips):** each chart had its own bespoke recharts tooltip, so charts read as
  different products and hover felt inconsistent. Fix: one shared `ChartTooltip` (tokens, reduced-
  motion-gated fade, honest previous-period handling).

## Supersessions

- Pain 1 "card-grid overflow" → superseded by "false positive; the *reasons list* overflow was the
  real bug," fixed in `aa284d8`. Kept a Playwright regression guard.
- The earlier Phase B plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-analytics-frontend-phaseB.md`) is
  superseded by the v4 gate plans; left untracked, not committed.
- `InsightsPanel` (top full-width card) → superseded by `InsightsRail` (Pain 7).
- Draft double-ring logomark → superseded by the chosen "Aperture & check" mark.

## Removals + rationale

- **`InsightsPanel`** (top full-width "What changed" card) — removed; its content moved into the
  right-side rail (Pain 7). Served Q1/Q2 in a worse position (competed with data the user hadn't
  seen). No functionality lost.
- **`AbsliMasthead` / `PoweredByProofLens`** — removed; replaced by `ProofLensMasthead` +
  `TenantChip` (Pain 5). The old pair inverted BRAND §9.
- Nothing else removed — every surviving component maps to one of the four questions.

## Backend: made (additive) vs documented (pending)

**Made (additive, tested, zero scoring change):**
- `source="seed"` stored column + migration `0005` (Pain 3).
- Seeded review decisions via the existing review path (Pain 4).
- `flag_precision` block on `/v1/analytics/summary` (Pain 4).
- `system_health` block (`scored_without_content_pct`, `median_processing_ms`) (Pain 9).
- `/v1/results` already honoured `band`/`reason`/`rep_id`/`from`/`to` — used by the drill-down.

**Documented (pending, fenced — in `frontend/BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md`):**
- On-page faceting → needs a faceted analytics endpoint (Pain 11).
- `bucket=quarterly` for per-card override (Pain 8 quarterly).
- Viewer→hierarchy_node mapping (Pain 13).
- Usage counters table + increment/read (Pain 14).
- Chart-annotations table + CRUD (Pain 15).
- Scheduled email digest (Pain 10 next phase).
- A `/v1/results` node/branch filter (would let the team-hotspot rows drill down).

## Component inventory (reused vs new)

**Reused:** `Card`/`CardHeader`, `ChartCard` (extended with an `action` slot), `Button`,
`EmptyState`, `Skeleton`, `PageHeader` (`actions` slot), `TenantLogo`, `useUrlState`,
`useAnalytics`, the pure `insights`/`deltas`/`chartData`/`topFlagReasons`/`format` libs.

**New:** `ChartTooltip`, `ByTeamPanel` + `hotspots.ts`, `ReviewQuality`, `ExportControls` +
`exportCsv.ts`, `InsightsRail`, `SystemHealthLine`, `ProofLensMasthead`, `TenantChip`,
`ProofLensLogo` + `app/icon.svg`, `/methodology` page, drill-down chips on `/history`.

## Salesforce-doctrine audit

- **Borrowed well:** the Tremor bar-list pattern (reasons + team hotspots), rebuilt in our own
  tokens with **no dependency added**; drill-down-to-detail.
- **Deliberately NOT adopted:** splitting the page into tabs/sub-pages (breaks the
  What→Why→Where→What-next narrative) and Salesforce's high visual density — documented as the
  component-budget rule (max 7 top-level components; new widgets replace/relocate, never stack).
- **Borrowed incompletely, now fenced:** in-place faceting (Pain 11) — implemented as drill-out to
  /history for now; true in-place faceting needs a faceted endpoint (documented).

On-page faceting is fenced (drill-out to /history instead), so the "facet" column is n/a.

## Independent review

Two adversarial reviews (whole-branch code + live-page visual) were run mid-project. They confirmed
the data layer holds up and caught real bugs the author had missed — the "Last 90 days" `Infinity%`
honesty bug (fixed `504e58e`) and the reasons overflow / chart clipping (fixed `aa284d8`). The
"Unmapped 50% hotspot" honesty issue was caught on the live By-Team panel and fixed (excluded from
ranking, noted as coverage).

## Test + build state

Frontend: vitest green, typecheck + lint clean, production build green. Backend: pytest green
(209+), ruff + mypy clean, golden set intact. All changes additive.
